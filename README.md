Sign Language Translator: A Bi-Directional Communication System

This project aims to bridge the communication gap between individuals with 
hearing impairments and the general public by providing a 
bi-directional sign language translation system.

It includes two main features:

Sign Language to Text: Uses MediaPipe for hand landmark
detection and a trained MLP neural network model to recognize 
sign language gestures from a live webcam feed and convert them into readable text.

Text to Sign Language: Converts typed text into corresponding sign language
representations using a Tkinter-based GUI, displaying images of the hand signs for each letter.

The project is built using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Tkinter, and PyTorch,
ensuring real-time performance and accuracy. This tool can be highly beneficial
for people with hearing disabilities, enabling seamless communication in dailyÂ interactions.
